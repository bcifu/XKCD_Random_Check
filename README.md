# XKCD_Random_Check

This is a project that checks if XKCD's random button is actually random.

It uses selenium webdriver **(you must download the chrome version)** to go to comics and see where the random leads to.

An upcoming project will use the data downloaded and saved in pickle files to do some interesting graphs and to see if XKCD is really as random as it says.

*I was bored, that's why I did this. I'm pretty sure it's random, but sometimes I feel like it is a little biased so I wanted to check for myself.*
